## Introduction ??

Welcome to the **MS Agent Framework Experiments** repository! This project is a learning playground for exploring **Microsoft Agent Framework**, a recently introduced framework for building intelligent AI agents. 

As I continue my learning journey, this repository will evolve with new features and experiments including:
- ?? **Reasoning** - Advanced agent reasoning capabilities
- ?? **Memory** - Persistent and contextual memory systems
- ??? **Tool Calling** - Function calling and external tool integration
- ?? **MCP Tool Calling** - Model Context Protocol integrations
- ?? **Workflows** - Sequential and conditional agent workflows
- ?? **Agentic Workflows** - Autonomous agent decision-making
- ?? **Multi-Agent Workflows** - Collaborative multi-agent systems
- ?? **Search Tools** - Web search and knowledge retrieval
- ?? **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Document-based Q&A systems

## Prerequisites ???
